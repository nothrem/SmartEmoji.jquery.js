#jquery.emojiarea.js

This library is inspired by [OneSignal/emoji-picker](https://github.com/OneSignal/emoji-picker) and [diy/jquery-emojiarea](https://github.com/diy/jquery-emojiarea)

It has been rewritten from scratch with easy usability from the developer perspective in mind.

Out comes a much cleaner, smaller and more flexible emoji library than all others I know of.
